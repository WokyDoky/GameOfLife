## Conway's Game of Life 

The Game of Life, also known simply as Conway's Game of Life or simply Life,
is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway
in 1970.
It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial
state, requiring no further input.
One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and
observing how it evolves.

### Rules
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. 
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation. 
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

### Work
- [ ] Program shall allow User to click and drag mouse to create patters.
- [ ] Should be able to play, stop, and ff game. 

### Would be nice: 
- [ ] Possibly zoom in and out of the screen to see bigger patters. 
- [ ] Hopefully add AI to predict patterns and what-not.
